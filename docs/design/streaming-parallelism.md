# Intra-node streaming parallelism (closing the per-node throughput gap)

## Why this exists
Phase-2 AWS head-to-head (`docs/benchmarks/FLINK_HEAD_TO_HEAD.md`): per **core**, Vajra
beats Flink (stateless 1.34×, windowed ~3×, memory ~16×). But Vajra streaming runs on a
**single core** regardless of node size, so per **node** Flink can scale past us via
`parallelism=N`. Closing that is the one remaining throughput lever.

## Phase 0 finding (measured 2026-06-10) — multi-partition currently *regresses*
Local release build, stateless `rate → filter → memory`, `rowsPerSecond=80M`:

| `numPartitions` | throughput |
|--:|--:|
| 1 | **28.9M/s** |
| 4 | 8.18M/s (**~3.5× slower**) |

**Root cause (code-confirmed):**
- The rate source *can* emit N partitions (`num_partitions` option), and streaming
  `FilterExec` preserves partitioning.
- But every **sink** (`memory_sink_exec.rs`, `collector.rs`) is `UnknownPartitioning(1)`
  with a `partition != 0` guard and calls `self.input.execute(0, …)`.
- So DataFusion's `EnforceDistribution` inserts a **single-threaded
  `CoalescePartitionsExec`** to funnel N→1 before the sink, and the streaming driver only
  executes partition 0. Result: N small-batch partitions merged on one thread is *slower*
  than one big-batch partition.
- The rewriter also treats `LogicalPlan::Repartition` as a **no-op** ("data arrives as a
  single flow-event stream") — the whole model assumes one stream end-to-end.

So parallelism isn't "almost working" — it's architecturally single-stream. This is the
build.

## Architecture (v2, post-review) — reuse the engine we already have
**Vajra already ships a distributed shuffle** (`sail-execution`: `ShuffleWriteExec`,
`ShuffleReadExec`, `RepartitionExec` with `Partitioning::Hash`/`RoundRobinBatch`, job-graph
planner, task runner, spill). Streaming currently **bypasses** it (`sail-plan/src/lib.rs`
disables repartition for streaming "so the pipeline runs unbroken").

**Decision: do NOT build a bespoke parallel driver. Make the existing partitioned-execution
machinery flow-event/marker-aware, and express parallelism in the PLAN.** The streaming
driver stays thin (drives the sink's N partitions via `execute(i)`). Consequence —
**intra-node parallelism is the single-node case of distributed execution: scale-up and
scale-out are one mechanism.** (On-goal: one engine, reuse mature DataFusion/Apache
machinery; distributed streaming later for nearly free.)

### Grounded references
- **DataFusion `RepartitionExec`** (docs.rs): N→M by `Partitioning` (`RoundRobinBatch`,
  `Hash`); **bounded** per-(in,out) channels (preserves our memory edge). Reuse + wrap for
  markers.
- **Flink:** keyed exchange + **watermark = min across inputs with idleness detection**
  (`withIdleness` — else an idle input stalls all windows); **Chandy–Lamport / aligned
  checkpoint barriers** via a **CheckpointCoordinator**; **credit-based flow control**.
- **Spark:** stateless parallelizes freely (one output file per task, no coalesce);
  stateful uses a hash (shuffle) exchange; skew handled via partial-agg/salting.

### Non-negotiable principles (protect the differentiators)
1. **Cost-based, not always-on.** Phase 0 showed 1 big-batch partition (28.9M/s) **beats**
   4 small-batch partitions (8.18M/s). Repartition only when a single core is CPU-bound;
   otherwise bigger batches on one core win (no shuffle, ordering kept, less memory). Never
   trade per-core efficiency (our real edge) for per-node vanity numbers.
2. **Bounded + backpressured exchange** (credit-based) — an unbounded buffer would destroy
   the 7.5–16× memory win, which is *the* differentiator.
3. **Markers are control-plane:** data is routed (round-robin / hash-by-key); markers are
   **broadcast**; watermark = **min with idleness**; checkpoint = **barrier-aligned via a
   coordinator**; `EndOfData` = all-N. Get this wrong and stateful correctness/exactly-once
   silently breaks.

### Advancements (toward outperforming both, not just parity)
- **Unified scale-up == scale-out** (one exchange for intra-node and distributed) — leaner
  than engines that maintain separate paths.
- **NUMA / core-affinity for partition workers** — a native, no-JVM advantage.
- Later: **unaligned checkpoints** (low latency under backpressure) + **reactive
  autoscaling** (load-adaptive parallelism).

### The marker rule (the crux for flow-events)
A flow-event stream carries control markers (`Watermark`, `Checkpoint{id}`, `EndOfData`,
`LatencyTracker`) interleaved with data. Across partitions:
- **Data**: routed by scheme (round-robin for stateless, **hash-by-key** for stateful).
- **Markers**: **broadcast to all output partitions.**
- **Watermark** at a multi-input operator = **min** over per-input watermarks.
- **Checkpoint** = **barrier alignment**: wait for the marker on *all* input channels
  before snapshotting (preserves the exactly-once we already built).
- **EndOfData**: the driver/coalesce completes only after **all N** inputs signal it.

## Phase 1 root-cause (confirmed 2026-06-10)
Tracing the multi-partition stateless write end-to-end:
- The source emits N partitions; `FilterExec`, `FlowEventToDataExec`, `EmptySinkAdapterExec`
  all **preserve** partitioning; Vajra's `create_writer` does **not** reject multi-partition.
- **The hard stop is DataFusion's `DataSinkExec`** — `datafusion-datasource/src/sink.rs:103`:
  *"DataSinkExec requires its input to have a single partition."* For batch the optimizer
  coalesces N→1; for an **unbounded (streaming) multi-partition** input it rejects →
  surfaced as `cannot write streaming data to listing table`. (Memory sink doesn't reject —
  it just coalesces N→1 single-threaded, the Phase-0 regression.)

**So Phase 1 ≠ tweak the existing sink.** It needs a **dedicated parallel streaming file
sink** that bypasses `DataSinkExec`'s single-partition rule:
- `output_partitioning() == 1` (driver unchanged — sees one completion stream).
- `execute(0)` spawns **N writer tasks**; task `i` runs `input.execute(i)`, decodes
  flow-events, writes **its own file** (`part-i.parquet`) via the Arrow/Parquet writer,
  tracks per-partition `EndOfData`.
- Completes only when **all N** tasks finish (all-N `EndOfData`) → then the driver's
  offset/state commit fires (exactly-once unaffected — commit still after all durable).
- Tests first: N-file output == 1-file output (same rows, no loss/dup); `availableNow`
  waits for all N; cost-gate (don't engage below CPU-bound).

## Build phases (re-sequenced around reuse + the exchange primitive)
- **Phase 0: measure + root-cause.** ✅ Done — multi-partition regresses; cause known.
- **Phase 1 — flow-event exchange primitive + parallel stateless path.** Wrap the existing
  `RepartitionExec` as a **marker-aware `StreamExchangeExec`** (route data round-robin,
  **broadcast** markers, all-N `EndOfData`) + make the **stateless sink multi-partition**
  (reuse DataFusion's per-partition sink — one file per partition). Gate parallelism behind
  a **cost check** (only when single-core CPU-bound). Target: stateless `source →
  map/filter → write` scales ~N× *when CPU-bound*. No stateful/exactly-once risk.
- **Phase 2 — keyed (hash) exchange** for stateful ops + **multi-partition
  `WindowAccumExec`/`StreamJoinExec`** (per-partition keyed state) + **watermark min-merge
  WITH idleness detection** (idle input must not stall windows). Document **key-skew**
  handling (partial-agg / salting).
- **Phase 3 — CheckpointCoordinator** (Chandy–Lamport, aligned barriers): trigger → align →
  ack → single commit wired to the existing offset-WAL + state-commit, so **exactly-once
  survives parallelism**.
- **Phase 4 — unify with distributed** (same exchange over the network shuffle) +
  observability (per-partition throughput, watermark lag, backpressure, checkpoint
  align-time). Later: unaligned checkpoints, reactive autoscaling, NUMA affinity.

## Correctness gates (write tests FIRST — this is exactly-once-adjacent)
- Stateless N-partition output == single-partition output (same rows, no loss/dup); order
  contract documented (repartition breaks row order).
- `availableNow` terminates only after **all N** partitions reach `EndOfData`.
- Parallelism is **not** engaged below the CPU-bound threshold (perf regression guard —
  don't lose to the 1-big-batch case).
- Stateful (P2): windows emit **once** with correct counts under hash exchange; **idle
  partition does not stall** watermark/window close.
- Exactly-once (P3): kill-restart across N partitions → no gap/dup; commit is atomic across
  all partitions (single coordinator cut).
